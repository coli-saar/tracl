# 🚀 Tracl Showcase

On this page, we collect \*ACL papers that have been written in Typst. Please feel free to add your own papers by submitting a pull request.

You can add tracl-written papers once you have submitted them to Arxiv, but of course people will be extra interested in papers that have been accepted to a conference - those demonstrate that tracl is a valid way to write \*ACL papers. So remember to update your paper once it's accepted.
